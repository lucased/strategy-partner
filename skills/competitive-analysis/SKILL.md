description: Competitive advantage analysis using Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers framework and Lafley/Martin's Playing to Win methodology. Use when analyzing competitive positioning, identifying sustainable advantages, determining "how to win", or assessing competitive moats. Essential for strategy development.

# Competitive Analysis Skill

## Purpose

Analyze competitive dynamics and identify sustainable sources of advantage. Combines Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers framework (for durable competitive advantage) with Lafley & Martin's "Where to Play / How to Win" strategic choice cascade.

## The 7 Powers Framework

Each Power creates a barrier that allows persistent differential returns. For each potential Power, assess:
1. **Do we have it?** (current state)
2. **Can we build it?** (feasibility)
3. **How durable is it?** (time to erode)
4. **What would break it?** (vulnerabilities)

### Power 1: Scale Economies
**Definition**: Per-unit cost declines as volume increases

**Indicators you have it**:
- Significant fixed costs that spread across volume
- Cost advantages that grow with scale
- Competitors can't match your unit economics at their volume

**Questions to assess**:
- What percentage of costs are fixed vs. variable?
- At what scale do unit economics become attractive?
- How much of the market do we need to capture for scale to matter?
- Can competitors achieve similar scale in a focused segment?

**Durability factors**:
- How defensible is your volume position?
- Can technology disrupt your cost structure?
- Are there diseconomies at larger scale?

### Power 2: Network Effects
**Definition**: Value to each user increases as more users join

**Types**:
- **Direct**: Users benefit directly from more users (social networks)
- **Indirect**: More users attract complementary offerings (platforms)
- **Data**: More usage improves the product (ML models)

**Questions to assess**:
- Does each additional user make the product more valuable to existing users?
- What's the minimum network size for value to emerge?
- Are network effects local or global? (local = more vulnerable)
- Can users multi-home on competitor networks?

**Durability factors**:
- Switching costs for users
- Winner-take-all vs. winner-take-most dynamics
- Risk of fragmentation or niche networks

### Power 3: Counter-Positioning
**Definition**: A newcomer adopts a superior business model that incumbents can't copy without damaging their existing business

**Indicators you have it**:
- Your model would cannibalize incumbent revenue
- Incumbents face organizational/cultural barriers to copying
- Copying requires capabilities incumbents lack

**Questions to assess**:
- If incumbents copied us, would it hurt their core business?
- What organizational barriers prevent incumbents from responding?
- How long until the threat is too large to ignore?
- What happens when incumbents finally respond?

**Durability factors**:
- Time window before incumbents must respond
- Your speed of growth during the window
- Incumbents' ability to create separate units to compete

### Power 4: Switching Costs
**Definition**: Customers face costs when switching to a competitor

**Types**:
- **Financial**: Direct costs, termination fees, new purchases
- **Procedural**: Learning costs, setup time, workflow changes
- **Relational**: Personal relationships, brand attachment, trust

**Questions to assess**:
- What would a customer lose by switching?
- How much time/money would switching require?
- What data/history/customization is trapped in your system?
- Do customers recognize these switching costs?

**Durability factors**:
- Increasing or decreasing over time?
- Can competitors offer migration assistance?
- Regulatory risk (portability requirements)?

### Power 5: Branding
**Definition**: Durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering

**Indicators you have it**:
- Price premium for equivalent functionality
- Customer preference independent of features
- Emotional connection and loyalty

**Questions to assess**:
- Would customers pay more for your product if functionally equivalent to competitors?
- What associations do customers have with your brand?
- How long did it take to build this brand equity?
- What would damage the brand irreparably?

**Durability factors**:
- Brand maintenance investment required
- Vulnerability to reputation events
- Category relevance over time

---

### Power 6: Cornered Resource
**Definition**: Preferential access to a valuable resource at attractive terms

**Types**:
- Talent (key individuals, teams)
- IP (patents, trade secrets, proprietary data)
- Physical assets (locations, raw materials)
- Regulatory advantages (licenses, permits)

**Questions to assess**:
- What resources do you have that competitors can't acquire?
- How did you obtain this access? Is it repeatable?
- What's the alternative for competitors lacking this resource?
- Could the resource become less valuable?

**Durability factors**:
- Legal/contractual protections
- Resource obsolescence risk
- Can the resource walk away (e.g., talent)?

### Power 7: Process Power
**Definition**: Organization-embedded improvements that competitors can't replicate

**Indicators you have it**:
- Operational excellence that's hard to reverse-engineer
- Culture-driven advantages
- Tacit knowledge embedded in teams

**Questions to assess**:
- What do we do better that competitors have tried and failed to copy?
- How long did it take to develop these capabilities?
- Is this documented/codified or tacit/cultural?
- Could a key hire transfer this capability to a competitor?

**Durability factors**:
- Complexity of the process (harder to copy = more durable)
- Cultural vs. procedural (cultural = more durable)
- Rate of industry process innovation

## Where to Play / How to Win Framework

### Where to Play Choices

Define your competitive arena across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Choices |
|-----------|---------|
| **Geography** | Which regions/countries? |
| **Customer segments** | Which types of customers? |
| **Products/Services** | Which offerings? |
| **Channels** | How do you reach customers? |
| **Vertical stage** | Where in the value chain? |

**Critical requirement**: Explicitly state where you will NOT play.

### How to Win Choices

For each "Where to Play" choice, define your competitive approach:

**Cost Leadership Path**:
- Lower cost structure than competitors
- Pass savings to customers OR earn higher margins
- Requires: Scale, operational excellence, or structural advantages

**Differentiation Path**:
- Offer something customers value and competitors lack
- Command price premium OR win more customers at same price
- Requires: Unique capabilities, brand, or positioning

### Capability Requirements

For your chosen "How to Win", identify:
1. **Must-have capabilities**: Non-negotiable for the strategy to work
2. **Differentiating capabilities**: Create competitive advantage
3. **Capability gaps**: What must be built/acquired?
