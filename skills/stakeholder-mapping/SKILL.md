description: Stakeholder analysis and organizational reality assessment for strategy development. Use when analyzing internal politics, identifying decision-makers and influencers, understanding incentive structures, assessing organizational change capacity, or planning strategy execution. Critical for understanding whether a strategy can actually be implemented.

# Stakeholder Mapping Skill

## Purpose

Strategies fail not just from poor analysis, but from ignoring organizational realities. This skill helps map the human landscape that will determine whether a strategy gets executed or dies on arrival.

## Core Assessment Areas

### 1. Power & Decision Rights

**Goal**: Understand who actually makes decisions (vs. who has formal authority)

#### Key Questions
- Who has veto power over this strategy?
- Who owns the budget and resources needed?
- Which executives/teams must actively support vs. passively accept this?
- Where is there already alignment vs. active resistance?
- Who can kill this with inaction alone?

#### Power Mapping Exercise

For each key stakeholder, assess:

| Stakeholder | Formal Authority | Informal Influence | Decision Rights | Veto Power |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| [Name/Role] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [What they control] | [Y/N] |

**Informal influence sources**:
- Relationships with executives
- Historical credibility (past successes)
- Control over critical information
- Reputation among peers
- External network (board, customers, investors)

---

### 2. Incentive Structures

**Goal**: Understand what motivates each stakeholder (rational self-interest)

#### Key Questions
- How are key stakeholders measured and compensated?
- Does this strategy help or hurt their personal success metrics?
- What would make them look bad if this succeeds?
- Whose budget/headcount/scope would this affect?
- Who stands to gain power/status if this succeeds?
- Who stands to lose power/status if this succeeds?

#### Incentive Alignment Matrix

| Stakeholder | Current Incentives | Strategy Impact on Their Metrics | Alignment |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| [Name/Role] | [What they're measured on] | [+/-/neutral] | [Aligned/Opposed/Neutral] |

**Warning signs of misalignment**:
- Strategy requires behavior their compensation discourages
- Success would reduce their scope/budget/headcount
- Their metrics conflict with strategy metrics
- History of blocking similar initiatives

### 3. Organizational Capability Reality

**Goal**: Honestly assess what the organization can actually execute (not aspirations)

#### Key Questions
- What is the organization actually good at executing? (track record, not intentions)
- What have similar transformation efforts achieved here?
- What's the real capacity for change? (be brutally honest)
- What sacred cows exist that can't be touched?
- How many major initiatives are already in flight?

#### Capability Assessment

| Capability Needed | Current State | Gap Severity | Build/Buy/Partner |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Capability] | [0-5 rating] | [Critical/Major/Minor] | [Approach] |

**Change capacity factors**:
- Recent change fatigue (too many initiatives?)
- Management attention bandwidth
- Track record of completing major initiatives
- Quality of middle management (where execution happens)
- Cultural openness to change

### 4. Political Landscape

**Goal**: Understand the informal dynamics that determine what's actually possible

#### Coalition Mapping

**Supporters** (will actively champion):
- Who benefits most from this strategy?
- Who has the most to gain personally?
- Who believes in this direction independently?

**Opponents** (will actively resist):
- Who sees this as a threat?
- Who philosophically disagrees?
- Who has competing priorities that conflict?

**Neutrals** (could go either way):
- Who is indifferent?
- Who is persuadable with the right framing?
- Who will follow the prevailing wind?

#### Political Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| [Stakeholder] blocks funding | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Action] |
| [Team] slow-walks implementation | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Action] |
| Competing initiative gets priority | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Action] |

### 5. Communication & Influence Strategy

**Goal**: Plan how to build support for the strategy

#### For Each Key Stakeholder

1. **Frame**: How should this strategy be positioned to resonate with their concerns?
2. **Channel**: Who is best positioned to communicate with them?
3. **Timing**: When should they be engaged? (early input vs. late inform)
4. **Ask**: What specific commitment do we need from them?

#### Engagement Sequencing

| Phase | Stakeholders to Engage | Purpose | Key Messages |
|-------|----------------------|---------|--------------|
| Input gathering | [List] | Get buy-in through involvement | "Shaping the direction" |
| Socialization | [List] | Build awareness and support | "Here's where we're heading" |
| Decision | [List] | Secure formal approval | "We need your sign-off" |
| Launch | [List] | Enable execution | "Here's what we need from you" |

## Stakeholder Interview Questions

Use these when gathering input from key stakeholders:

### Understanding Their World
1. What are your top 3 priorities for this year?
2. What keeps you up at night about our business?
3. What would success look like from your perspective?

### Gauging Support
4. What concerns do you have about this direction?
5. What would need to be true for you to fully support this?
6. What's worked/failed in similar past efforts?

### Identifying Constraints
7. What resources or decisions do you control that this would need?
8. What trade-offs would this require from your area?
9. Who else should we be talking to about this?

## Stakeholder & Organizational Reality Assessment

### Decision Rights Map
| Stakeholder | Authority Level | Must-Have Support | Current Position |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| [Name/Role] | [Veto/Approve/Influence/Inform] | [Y/N] | [Champion/Supporter/Neutral/Skeptic/Opponent] |

### Incentive Alignment
**Aligned stakeholders**: [List with rationale]
**Misaligned stakeholders**: [List with specific conflicts]
**Mitigation strategies**: [How to address misalignment]

### Organizational Capability Assessment
| Capability | Current State (1-5) | Required State | Gap |
|------------|--------------------|--------------  |-----|
| [Capability] | [Score] | [Score] | [Description] |

**Change capacity**: [High/Medium/Low] because [rationale]
**Competing initiatives**: [List current major efforts]

### Political Landscape
```
Champions: [Names] — Will actively advocate
Supporters: [Names] — Will support if asked
Neutrals: [Names] — Persuadable with right approach
Skeptics: [Names] — Have concerns but open to persuasion
Opponents: [Names] — Will actively resist
```

### Key Political Risks
1. [Risk]: [Mitigation]
2. [Risk]: [Mitigation]

### Engagement Plan
| Stakeholder | Engagement Timing | Key Message | Ask |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-----|
| [Name] | [When] | [Message] | [Specific commitment] |

### Critical Success Factors (Organizational)
1. [Factor]: Without this, the strategy will fail because...
2. [Factor]: Without this, the strategy will fail because...

## Warning Signs

Watch for these signals that organizational reality will derail the strategy:

❌ **No clear owner** with authority AND incentive to drive it
❌ **Key decision-maker** has conflicting incentives
❌ **Strategy requires** capabilities the organization has never demonstrated
❌ **Too many initiatives** already competing for attention
❌ **Middle management** opposed or not engaged
❌ **Success metrics** conflict with existing measurement systems
❌ **Sacred cow** must be challenged but no one will
❌ **History of failed** similar initiatives without addressing root causes
