Use when checking strategy document structure, ensuring the narrative follows Diagnosis > Guiding Policy > Coherent Actions, or restructuring existing strategy documents for clarity and impact.

# Strategy Structure Reviewer Skill

## Purpose

A good strategy tells a story. This skill reviews strategy documents against Richard Rumelt's **"Good Strategy, Bad Strategy"** framework, ensuring every strategy document has:

1. **A clear diagnosis** of the challenge (The Crux)
2. **A guiding policy** for dealing with the challenge
3. **Coherent actions** designed to carry out the guiding policy

This skill also integrates complementary frameworks: Playing to Win (Lafley/Martin), Three Horizons (McKinsey), and 7 Powers (Helmer).

## The Rumelt Strategy Kernel

From "Good Strategy, Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt:

> **"The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action."**

```

## The Three-Act Narrative Structure

The recommended structure for strategy documents, mapping to Rumelt's kernel:

### PROLOGUE: THE CRUX
The opening hook - states the critical challenge in one powerful statement.

> **Example**: "BTC Markets must validate B2B2C demand and build commercial capability fast enough to monetise the market licence before capital constraints or competitor moves close the window."

**Quality Criteria**:
- [ ] One clear, compelling statement of the strategic challenge
- [ ] Names the real problem (not symptoms)
- [ ] Creates tension that the document resolves
- [ ] Can be understood in under 30 seconds

---

### ACT I: WHERE WE ARE (Rumelt's DIAGNOSIS)

**Maps to**: Rumelt's Diagnosis - "A diagnosis that defines or explains the nature of the challenge."

| Section | Purpose | Frameworks |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **1. The Situation** | Market context, regulatory environment, competitive landscape | Porter's 5 Forces, PESTEL |
| **2. Our Position** | Current metrics, core differentiators, organizational reality (honest constraints) | SWOT, Resource-Based View |
| **3. The Inflection Point** | Why this moment matters, the strategic choice facing us | Inflection Points (Andy Grove) |

**Section 1: The Situation**
- [ ] Market size and growth quantified with sources
- [ ] Regulatory environment and key milestones
- [ ] Competitive landscape with specific competitors

- [ ] Aspirational but achievable
- [ ] Directly addresses the Crux

**Section 5: Strategic Choices**
- [ ] **Where We Will Play** - specific markets, segments, products

- [ ] Critical path dependencies visualized
- [ ] Stage-gating principles explicit

**Section 8: First Steps (Immediate Priorities)**
- [ ] 90-day validation sprints defined
- [ ] Specific actions with owners and success criteria
- [ ] Validation thresholds (what constitutes success/failure)
- [ ] Sprint governance cadence

**Section 9: How We'll Know (Metrics & Hypotheses)**
- [ ] North star metric identified

## Section Dependencies

When reviewing, verify these dependencies are satisfied:

### Forward Flow (Each section builds on the previous)

```
Prologue (Crux)
    │
    ├──→ Section 1 (Situation) explains the context for the crux
    │
    └──→ Section 2 (Position) explains our ability to address it
              │
              └──→ Section 3 (Inflection) creates urgency
                        │
                        └──→ Section 4 (Vision) responds to the crux
                                  │
                                  └──→ Section 5 (Choices) make trade-offs explicit
                                            │
                                            └──→ Section 6 (How to Win) builds advantage
                                                      │
                                                      └──→ Section 7 (Horizons) phases execution
                                                                │
                                                                └──→ Section 8 (First Steps) starts immediately
                                                                          │
                                                                          └──→ Section 9 (Metrics) tracks progress
                                                                                    │
                                                                                    └──→ Section 10 (Risks) prepares for failure
```

### Key Dependencies to Verify

| From | To | What Should Connect |
|------|-----|---------------------|
| Prologue | Section 4 | Vision must directly address the Crux |
| Section 2 (Weaknesses) | Section 5 | "We Will NOT" should acknowledge constraints |
| Section 5 (Choices) | Section 7 | Each "We Will" should map to horizon initiatives |
| Section 7 (H1) | Section 8 | H1 initiatives should appear in First Steps |
| Section 9 (Hypotheses) | Section 10 | "If false" triggers should link to fallback |

---

## Common Structural Issues

| Issue | Symptom | How to Fix |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Crux is buried** | No clear opening statement | Move the crux to Prologue, before any context |
| **All aspiration, no diagnosis** | Jumps to vision without explaining the challenge | Ensure Act I is complete before Act II |
| **Missing "We Will NOT"** | Section 5 only has positive commitments | Add 3-5 explicit exclusions |
| **Organizational reality ignored** | No honest assessment of constraints | Add "Organizational Reality" to Section 2 |
| **Horizons not stage-gated** | H2/H3 assumed regardless of H1 success | Add explicit gates and contingencies |
| **No fallback strategy** | Assumes the main thesis will work | Add Section 10 with pivot strategy |
| **Validation without thresholds** | Hypotheses but no numbers | Add specific thresholds and dates |
| **Crux not resolved** | Epilogue doesn't close the loop | Ensure commitment addresses original crux |

---

## Review Process

### Step 1: Crux Check
Read the Prologue. Is there a clear, compelling statement of the strategic challenge?

### Step 2: Rumelt Kernel Check
Does the document have all three elements?
- [ ] Diagnosis (Act I complete)
- [ ] Guiding Policy (Act II complete)
- [ ] Coherent Actions (Act III complete)

### Step 3: Section Presence Check
Verify all 12 sections are present.

### Step 4: Section Quality Check
For each section, validate against quality criteria checklist.

### Step 5: Framework Integration Check
Verify frameworks are properly integrated (Rumelt, Playing to Win, 7 Powers, Three Horizons).

### Step 6: Dependency Check
Verify forward dependencies flow logically.

### Step 7: Narrative Flow Assessment
Read end-to-end. Does it tell a compelling story that resolves the Crux?
