description: Three Horizons portfolio planning for strategy roadmaps and initiative sequencing. Use when mapping initiatives to timeframes, balancing short-term and long-term investments, creating phased roadmaps, or allocating resources across time horizons. Based on McKinsey's Three Horizons framework.

# Horizon Planning Skill

## Purpose

Balance the tension between optimizing today's business, building tomorrow's growth engines, and creating future options. Prevent common failure modes: over-investing in the core until disruption hits, or betting everything on unproven futures while the core collapses.

## The Three Horizons Framework

### Horizon 1 (H1): Extend & Defend the Core
**Timeframe**: Now – 12 months
**Focus**: Mature businesses that provide current cash flow and profits

**Characteristics**:
- Proven business model
- Existing customers and channels
- Optimize operations, reduce costs, improve efficiency
- Incremental improvements, not major changes
- Fund the other horizons

**Success metrics**: Revenue, margin, customer retention, operational efficiency

**Questions to classify as H1**:
- Does this improve our current core business?
- Does this protect existing revenue/customers?
- Is the business model proven and customers known?
- Will this generate returns within 12 months?

### Horizon 2 (H2): Build Emerging Businesses
**Timeframe**: 12 – 36 months
**Focus**: Emerging opportunities requiring investment to scale

**Characteristics**:
- Business model validated but not yet at scale
- Known customer need, building product-market fit
- Adjacent to core (new products, new markets, or new models)
- Requires dedicated resources and management attention
- Bridge between today and transformational future

**Success metrics**: Revenue growth rate, market share gains, product-market fit indicators

**Questions to classify as H2**:
- Is there validated customer demand?
- Do we have a testable business model hypothesis?
- Can this scale within 2-3 years?
- Is this adjacent to existing capabilities or markets?

### Horizon 3 (H3): Create Future Options
**Timeframe**: 36+ months
**Focus**: Seeds for future growth, often uncertain but high potential

**Characteristics**:
- Experimental, high uncertainty
- May disrupt existing business (including our own)
- Research projects, pilots, venture investments
- Small bets, options-based thinking
- Not dependent on near-term results

**Success metrics**: Learning velocity, option value, strategic positioning

**Questions to classify as H3**:
- Is this highly uncertain but potentially transformational?
- Are we exploring/learning rather than scaling?
- Could this be a future H2 or H1?
- Can we afford to be wrong?

## Initiative Classification Process

### Step 1: List All Strategic Initiatives
Inventory all proposed and in-flight initiatives:
- Product development efforts
- Market expansion plans
- Operational improvements
- Technology investments
- Partnership/M&A opportunities
- Organizational changes

### Step 2: Classify Each Initiative

For each initiative, answer:

| Question | H1 Answer | H2 Answer | H3 Answer |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Business model status | Proven | Validated, not scaled | Hypothesis |
| Customer clarity | Known customers | Known need, finding customers | Exploring |
| Time to meaningful results | <12 months | 12-36 months | 36+ months |
| Risk profile | Low, operational | Medium, execution | High, strategic |
| Funding approach | P&L funded | Separate budget, milestones | Small bets, learning |

### Step 3: Validate Classification

Test each classification:
- **H1 that feels like H2**: Are you avoiding hard optimization decisions?
- **H2 that feels like H1**: Are you being too conservative with emerging bets?
- **H3 that feels like H2**: Are you over-committing to unvalidated ideas?

## Resource Allocation Framework

### Typical Allocation Guidelines

| Company Stage | H1 | H2 | H3 | Rationale |
|---------------|----|----|----|-----------|
| Startup | 50% | 40% | 10% | Finding product-market fit |
| Growth | 60% | 30% | 10% | Scaling proven model |
| Mature/Stable | 70% | 20% | 10% | Protecting core while exploring |
| Disrupted | 40% | 40% | 20% | Urgent need for transformation |

**Adjust based on**:
- Industry rate of change
- Competitive pressure
- Cash position
- Risk tolerance

### Resource Types to Allocate
- **Financial**: Budget dollars, capital investment
- **People**: Headcount, leadership attention, best talent
- **Time**: Management calendar, organizational focus

## Sequencing & Dependencies

### Dependency Types

1. **Prerequisite**: Must complete A before starting B
2. **Enables**: A makes B more likely to succeed
3. **Funds**: A generates resources for B
4. **Competes**: A and B compete for same resources

### Sequencing Principles

1. **H1 funds H2 and H3**: Core business health enables bets
2. **H3 graduates to H2**: Successful experiments become emerging businesses
3. **H2 graduates to H1**: Scaled businesses become new core
4. **Cannibalization planning**: When will H2/H3 disrupt H1?

### Dependency Mapping

```
[H1 Initiative A] ----enables----> [H2 Initiative B]
       |                                    |
     funds                              graduates to
       |                                    |
       v                                    v
[H3 Experiment C]              [Future H1 Business D]
```

## Governance by Horizon

### H1 Governance
- Quarterly business reviews
- Standard operating metrics
- P&L accountability
- Efficiency and optimization focus

### H2 Governance
- Monthly milestone reviews
- Growth-focused metrics
- Separate budget with stage gates
- Balance between growth and path to profitability

### H3 Governance
- Discovery/learning reviews (not ROI reviews)
- Hypothesis testing metrics
- Small, contained budgets
- Kill criteria defined upfront

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **All H1**: No investment in future growth; vulnerable to disruption
❌ **Overweight H3**: "Innovation theater" without business impact
❌ **No H2**: Gap between core and experiments; nothing scales
❌ **Wrong governance**: Applying H1 ROI metrics to H3 experiments
❌ **Unclear graduation**: No criteria for when initiatives move between horizons
❌ **Best people on H1**: Emerging businesses need best talent, not just budget
