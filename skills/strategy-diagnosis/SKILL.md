# Strategy Diagnosis Skill

## Purpose

Strategy is a response to a challenge. This skill guides you through Rumelt's diagnostic process: understanding what's going on, identifying why it's difficult, finding the crux (the critical solvable challenge), and formulating a proximate objective that makes progress achievable.

Most strategy failures begin with inadequate diagnosis—confusing goals with strategy, evading the real challenge, or setting objectives as difficult as the original problem.

---

## The Strategy Kernel

Good strategy has a logical structure called **the kernel**, with three elements:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│  DIAGNOSIS  │ ──▶ │ GUIDING POLICY  │ ──▶ │ COHERENT ACTIONS │
│             │     │                 │     │                  │
│ "What's     │     │ The approach    │     │ Coordinated      │
│  going on   │     │ chosen to deal  │     │ steps that       │
│  here?"     │     │ with obstacles  │     │ implement the    │
│             │     │ (like           │     │ policy           │
│ The crux    │     │  guardrails)    │     │                  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
```

**This skill covers Diagnosis.** The diagnosis identifies barriers to progress and culminates in the crux—the one challenge that is both critical and solvable.

## Part 1: Identify the Challenge

### "What's Going On Here?"

The first task is comprehending the situation. Strategy is fundamentally about what you'll do in response to a challenge—not about goals, visions, or aspirations.

**Key questions:**
- What is the challenge we face?
- What triggered the need for this strategy effort?
- If we do nothing, what happens in 12/24/36 months?
- What would a competitor say our real problem is?

### Challenge vs. Goals

| Challenge | Goal |
|-----------|------|
| "Customer acquisition cost exceeds lifetime value" | "Grow revenue 30%" |
| "Our product is undifferentiated in a commoditizing market" | "Become market leader" |
| "Key talent is leaving for competitors" | "Build world-class team" |

**The test:** Without a clearly stated challenge, assessing whether a strategy is good or bad is impossible. Goals are not strategy.

### Framing the Challenge

Write a clear statement of the challenge:

> "The challenge we face is _____________. This has become urgent because _____________. If we don't address it, _____________."

---

## Part 2: Diagnose — "Why Is This Difficult?"

### The Breakthrough Question

Rumelt's key insight: Instead of asking "What should we do?" or "What are our goals?", ask:

> **"Why is this difficult?"**

This question surfaces the real obstacles, cuts through success theater, and reveals what actually needs to be overcome.

### Forces at Work

Investigate the forces creating this challenge:

**External forces:**
- What market, competitive, or environmental changes are driving this?
- What external parties benefit from the status quo?
- What trends are accelerating or decelerating this problem?

**Internal forces:**
- Who or what benefits from the status quo internally?
- What organizational antibodies have killed similar efforts before?
- What capabilities are missing?
- What constraints are we working within? (resources, time, politics, regulations)

**Structural vs. Situational:**
- Is this a temporary situation or a structural reality?
- What underlying structure creates this problem?
- Would this problem exist regardless of who was in charge?

### Barriers to Progress

A diagnosis identifies the **barriers to forward progress**. List the specific obstacles:

| Barrier | Type | Removable? |
|---------|------|------------|
| [Obstacle 1] | [Structural/Situational/Capability/Political] | [Yes/No/Partially] |
| [Obstacle 2] | ... | ... |

### ⚠️ Success Theater Warning

Organizations often avoid honest diagnosis to maintain appearances. Watch for:

- Problems that are "comfortable" to discuss vs. the actual critical challenge
- Diagnosis that blames external factors while ignoring internal issues
- Vague language that obscures rather than clarifies
- Unwillingness to name specific barriers

**Ask:** "What are we most afraid of admitting about our situation?"

---

## Part 3: Find the Crux

### The Dual Requirement

The crux is the ONE challenge that is BOTH:

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Critical** | If we solve this, does it make the biggest difference? |
| **Solvable** | Can we actually do something about this? |

The crux is NOT:
- The most important challenge you can't solve
- A laundry list of all challenges
- A goal or aspiration
- The most comfortable problem to discuss

### The Power of Focus

> "As understanding deepens, the strategist seeks the crux—the one challenge that both is critical and appears to be solvable. This narrowing down is the source of much of the strategist's power, as focus remains the cornerstone of strategy." — Rumelt

Like rock climbing, the crux is the hardest pitch that you believe you can actually solve. You don't attempt unclimbable faces.

### Finding the Crux Process

1. **List all significant challenges** identified in diagnosis
2. **For each, assess:**
   - How critical is it? (If solved, how much progress does it unlock?)
   - How solvable is it? (Given our capabilities and resources)
3. **Plot on matrix:**

```
                    SOLVABILITY
                 Low           High
           ┌──────────┬──────────────┐
      High │ Frustrating │  THE CRUX   │
CRITICALITY│ (important  │  (focus     │
           │  but stuck) │   here)     │
           ├──────────┼──────────────┤
       Low │ Ignore    │ Quick wins   │
           │           │ (do these    │
           │           │  but not     │
           │           │  strategic)  │
           └──────────┴──────────────┘
```

4. **Select the crux** — The challenge in the upper-right quadrant that, if overcome, would make the biggest difference

### Crux Statement Format

> "The crux of our challenge is [specific obstacle]. This is critical because [impact if not addressed]. We believe it is solvable because [what makes it addressable]. If we can overcome this, [cascade effects]."

---

## Part 4: Formulate Proximate Objective

### Close Enough to Be Feasible

A good strategy creates a **proximate objective** — one close enough at hand to be achievable.

> "If the leader's strategic objectives are just as difficult to accomplish as the original challenge, there has been little value added by the strategy." — Rumelt

### The Leader's Job

An important duty is to absorb complexity and pass on a simpler, solvable problem. The proximate objective:

- Is **feasible** — the organization can reasonably hit it
- Is **focused** — names a specific target
- **Creates options** — positions for future moves
- **Reduces ambiguity** — clarifies what "winning" looks like

### The Dynamic Principle

The more uncertain the situation, the more proximate the objective must be. In dynamic environments, long-range objectives become guesses. Set objectives close enough that you can actually see the target.

### Proximate Objective Format

Given the crux, what is a feasible objective that would represent meaningful progress?

> "Our proximate objective is to [specific achievable target] by [timeframe]. This is feasible because [evidence/capabilities]. Achieving this would [impact on the crux]."

**Quality test:** Is this objective genuinely achievable, or is it just a restated goal that's as hard as the original challenge?

---

## Part 5: Bridge to Guiding Policy

### From Diagnosis to Policy

The diagnosis and crux naturally constrain the range of sensible actions. A guiding policy is the **overall approach** chosen to deal with the obstacles identified.

Think of the guiding policy like guardrails on a highway — it directs and constrains action without fully defining every step.

### Policy Direction Questions

Based on your diagnosis and crux:
- What approach would address this crux?
- What must we **stop** doing?
- What must we **start** doing?
- What constraints should guide all decisions?

### Coherent Actions Preview

The guiding policy leads to coherent actions — coordinated steps that support each other. Actions should:
- Be **coordinated** — not independent or conflicting
- Be **resource-allocated** — backed by real commitment
- **Reinforce each other** — create compounding effects

## Four Hallmarks of Bad Strategy

Use these to check your diagnosis for common failures:

### 1. Fluff
Obscuring lack of substance with jargon and buzzwords.

❌ "We will leverage our synergies to drive stakeholder value through digital transformation"
✅ "We will reduce customer acquisition cost by focusing only on the enterprise segment"

**Test:** Can a new hire understand this in 2 minutes without insider knowledge?

### 2. Evasion
Failing to deal with the challenge head-on.

❌ Diagnosis that names symptoms but not causes
❌ Avoiding the uncomfortable truth
❌ Blaming external factors exclusively

**Test:** Does this diagnosis name specific, addressable obstacles?

### 3. Goal Confusion
Treating ambitious targets as strategy.

❌ "Our strategy is to grow revenue 40%"
❌ "We will become the market leader"
❌ "Strategy: Be the best"

**Test:** Is there a "how" that responds to a specific challenge?

### 4. Poor Proximate Objectives
Setting targets that are just as difficult as the original challenge.

❌ "To address declining market share, we will increase market share"
❌ Objectives that require capabilities you don't have
❌ "Blue sky" objectives with no path to achievement

**Test:** Is the objective genuinely achievable, or is it wishful thinking?

## Diagnostic Questions Bank

### Understanding the Challenge
1. What is the challenge we face? (Not goal—challenge)
2. Why is this difficult?
3. What's going on here?
4. If we do nothing, what happens?
5. What triggered the urgency now?

### Investigating Difficulty
6. What have we tried before? Why didn't it work?
7. What organizational antibodies killed previous efforts?
8. Who benefits from the status quo?
9. What would a competitor say our real problem is?
10. What are we most afraid of admitting?

### Finding the Crux
11. Which challenge, if solved, would make the biggest difference?
12. Of the critical challenges, which can we actually solve?
13. What one thing, if we got it right, would make everything else easier?
14. What do we need to overcome that we've been avoiding?

### Testing the Objective
15. Is this objective genuinely achievable?
16. Does it absorb complexity or just restate the original problem?
17. What would prove we've succeeded?
18. Is this close enough that we can see the target?
