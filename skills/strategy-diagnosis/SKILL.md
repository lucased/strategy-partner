description: Multi-layer problem diagnosis methodology for identifying the critical strategic challenge. Use when analyzing business problems, finding root causes, identifying leverage points, or formulating "the crux" of a strategic situation. Based on Rumelt's Good Strategy/Bad Strategy framework.

# Strategy Diagnosis Skill

## Purpose

Transform surface-level problem descriptions into rigorous strategic diagnoses. Most strategy failures begin with inadequate diagnosis—treating symptoms rather than root causes, or identifying comfortable problems rather than the actual critical challenge.

## The Diagnosis Process

Build the diagnosis in five sequential layers:

### Layer 1: Surface Symptoms
**Goal**: Capture what's immediately visible

Questions to ask:
- What pain is immediately visible?
- What metrics are declining or concerning?
- What complaints are you hearing (from customers, employees, investors)?
- What triggered the need for this strategy effort?

**Output**: List of observable symptoms

---

### Layer 2: Root Cause Analysis  
**Goal**: Understand why symptoms exist

Apply the "5 Whys" technique:
- Why is this happening?
- What changed to create this situation?
- What underlying structure creates this problem?
- Is this a people problem, process problem, or structural problem?

Questions to ask:
- What have you already tried that didn't work? Why did it fail?
- When did this problem first appear? What changed around that time?
- Who or what benefits from the status quo?
- What would a competitor say is your real problem?

**Output**: Causal chain from symptoms to underlying causes

---

### Layer 3: Problem Decomposition
**Goal**: Break the problem into addressable components

For each sub-problem, categorize:
- **Critical vs. peripheral**: Which matter most?
- **Solvable vs. constraints**: What can we change vs. must accept?
- **Sequential vs. parallel**: What order must we address these?

Questions to ask:
- Which part of this problem, if solved, would have the biggest impact?
- What constraints are absolute vs. negotiable?
- Are there dependencies between sub-problems?

**Output**: Problem component map with priorities

---

### Layer 4: Leverage Point Identification
**Goal**: Find where small changes create disproportionate impact

Look for:
- Constraints that, if removed, unlock multiple opportunities
- Capabilities that, if built, enable multiple strategic moves
- Decisions that would cascade positive effects

Questions to ask:
- Where can small changes create big impact?
- What one thing, if you got it right, would make everything else easier?
- What advantages do you have right now that you could lose?

**Output**: Prioritized list of leverage points

---

### Layer 5: The Crux
**Goal**: Synthesize into a single, sharp statement of the critical challenge

The crux must pass these tests:
1. **Centrality**: Does solving this make other problems easier or irrelevant?
2. **Honesty**: Is this the real problem, or just the most comfortable one to discuss?
3. **Actionability**: Can we actually do something about this?
4. **Falsifiability**: Could someone reasonably disagree with this diagnosis?

**Output format**:
> "The core challenge is [one sentence]. This matters because [impact]. The critical obstacle is [constraint]. If we can [leverage point], we will [unlock multiple opportunities]."

## Diagnostic Questions Bank

Use these questions during the diagnosis process:

### Situation Understanding
1. What triggered the need for this strategy? (specific event, trend, or gap)
2. If you do nothing, what happens in 12/24/36 months?
3. What are you most afraid of admitting about your situation?
4. Complete this: "We will fail if we don't address _______________"

### Past Attempts
5. What strategies have been tried before? Why did they fail?
6. What's different now that makes success more likely?
7. What organizational antibodies killed previous change efforts?

### External Forces
8. What would a competitor do if they were in your position?
9. What external forces are accelerating or decelerating this problem?
10. Who outside the organization benefits from the status quo?

### Internal Dynamics
11. Who benefits from the status quo internally?
12. What constraints are you working within? (resources, time, capabilities, politics, regulations)
13. What would you do if you had 10x the resources? What if you had only 10%?

## Common Diagnosis Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Mistaking Goals for Diagnosis
- ❌ "We need to grow revenue by 30%"
- ✅ "Our customer acquisition cost exceeds lifetime value because..."

### Pitfall 2: Comfortable Problems
- Watch for problems that are easy to discuss vs. the actual critical challenge
- The real problem is often the one people avoid mentioning

### Pitfall 3: Symptom Chasing
- Revenue decline is a symptom, not a diagnosis
- Ask "why" until you reach structural causes

### Pitfall 4: Overcomplicated Diagnosis
- If your diagnosis has 10 critical challenges, you don't have a diagnosis
- Force prioritization: "If we could only solve ONE thing..."

## Output Template

After completing the diagnosis, summarize as:

```markdown
## Strategic Diagnosis

### Surface Symptoms
- [Bullet list of observable problems]

### Root Cause Analysis
- [Causal chain explanation]

### Problem Components
| Component | Critical/Peripheral | Solvable/Constraint | Priority |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| [Name]    | [C/P]              | [S/C]              | [1-5]    |

### Leverage Points
1. [Primary leverage point]
2. [Secondary leverage point]

### The Crux
> [One-sentence statement of the critical challenge]

This matters because: [Impact statement]
The critical obstacle is: [Main constraint]
If we can [leverage action], we will [cascade effects].
```
