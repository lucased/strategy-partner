# Strategy Document Structure Definition

This template defines the **Three-Act Narrative Structure** for strategy documents, based on Richard Rumelt's "Good Strategy, Bad Strategy" framework.

## The Rumelt Strategy Kernel

From "Good Strategy, Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt:

> **"The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action."**

| Kernel Element | Purpose | Document Mapping |
|----------------|---------|------------------|
| **Diagnosis** | Defines the nature of the challenge | Prologue + Act I |
| **Guiding Policy** | Overall approach to overcome the challenge | Act II |
| **Coherent Actions** | Coordinated actions to carry out the policy | Act III |

## Section Guide

### PROLOGUE: THE CRUX

The opening hook that states the critical strategic challenge in one powerful statement.

| Must Include | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| One clear, compelling statement | "BTC Markets must validate B2B2C demand and build commercial capability fast enough to monetise the market licence before capital constraints or competitor moves close the window." |
| Why it's THE critical issue | Not just one of many challenges |
| Creates tension | Sets up what the document will resolve |

---

### ACT I: WHERE WE ARE (Diagnosis)

**Maps to**: Rumelt's Diagnosis - "A diagnosis that defines or explains the nature of the challenge."

| Section | Purpose | Must Include |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **1. The Situation** | External context | Market size/growth, regulatory milestones, competitive landscape, key trends |
| **2. Our Position** | Internal context | Current metrics, core differentiators, SWOT, **organizational reality** (honest constraints) |
| **3. The Inflection Point** | Why this moment | Window of opportunity, consequences of inaction, the strategic choice framed |

**Key Principle**: Be brutally honest in Section 2. Acknowledge constraints, capability gaps, and organizational realities.

---

### ACT II: WHERE WE'RE GOING (Guiding Policy)

**Maps to**: Rumelt's Guiding Policy - "A guiding policy for dealing with the challenge."

| Section | Purpose | Must Include |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **4. The Vision** | What winning looks like | Success states by timeframe (12/24/36 months) |
| **5. Strategic Choices** | Where to play | "We Will" list (5-8 items), **"We Will NOT" list (3-5 items)**, trade-offs |
| **6. How We Will Win** | Competitive advantage | 7 Powers analysis, value propositions by segment, core capability pillars |

**Key Principle**: Section 5 MUST include "We Will NOT" choices. A strategy without exclusions is not a strategy.

---

### ACT III: HOW WE'LL GET THERE (Coherent Actions)

**Maps to**: Rumelt's Coherent Actions - "A set of coherent actions designed to carry out the guiding policy."

| Section | Purpose | Must Include |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **7. Three Horizons** | Time-phased roadmap | H1 (0-12mo), H2 (12-24mo), H3 (24+mo), dependencies, **stage-gates** |
| **8. First Steps** | Immediate priorities | 90-day validation sprints, specific actions with owners, **success/failure thresholds** |
| **9. Metrics & Hypotheses** | How we measure | North star metric, KPIs with targets, **falsifiable hypotheses** with pivot triggers |
| **10. Risks & Fallback** | What could go wrong | Risk register, execution risks, **fallback strategy** (what if main thesis fails?) |

**Key Principle**: Include stage-gates and fallback strategies. Good strategy acknowledges uncertainty.

---

### EPILOGUE: COMMITMENT

| Section | Purpose | Must Include |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **11. Governance & Decisions** | How we'll manage | Review cadence (weekly/monthly/quarterly), key decision points with criteria |
| **12. Validation Scorecard** | Quality assessment | Seven tests scored (Clarity, Choicefulness, Coherence, Feasibility, Commitment, Disagreeability, Falsifiability) |

## Framework Integration

### Lafley/Martin: Playing to Win

| Question | Document Section |
|----------|------------------|
| What is our winning aspiration? | Section 4: The Vision |
| Where will we play? | Section 5: We Will |
| Where will we NOT play? | Section 5: We Will NOT |
| How will we win? | Section 6: How We Will Win |
| What capabilities must we have? | Section 6: Core Capability Pillars |
| What management systems are required? | Section 11: Governance & Decisions |

### McKinsey: Three Horizons

| Horizon | Timeframe | Document Section |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| H1: Extend and defend core | 0-12 months | Section 7.2 |
| H2: Build emerging businesses | 12-24 months | Section 7.3 |
| H3: Create viable options | 24+ months | Section 7.4 |

### Helmer: 7 Powers

Document any applicable powers in Section 6:

| Power | When It Applies |
|-------|-----------------|
| Scale Economies | Cost advantages from volume |
| Network Effects | Value increases with users |
| Counter-Positioning | Incumbent can't respond without self-harm |
| Switching Costs | Customers locked in |
| Cornered Resource | Exclusive access to asset |
| Process Power | Embedded organizational capabilities |
| Branding | Affective valence + uncertainty reduction |

---

## Section Dependencies

Verify these connections when reviewing:

| From | To | What Must Connect |
|------|-----|-------------------|
| Prologue (Crux) | Section 4 (Vision) | Vision must directly address the Crux |
| Section 2 (Weaknesses) | Section 5 (We Will NOT) | Exclusions should acknowledge constraints |
| Section 5 (Choices) | Section 7 (Horizons) | Each "We Will" must map to initiatives |
| Section 7 (H1) | Section 8 (First Steps) | H1 initiatives appear in First Steps |
| Section 9 (Hypotheses) | Section 10 (Fallback) | "If false" triggers link to fallback |

---

## Common Structural Issues

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Crux is buried** | No clear opening statement | Move to Prologue, before context |
| **All aspiration, no diagnosis** | Jumps to vision | Complete Act I before Act II |
| **Missing "We Will NOT"** | Only positive commitments | Add 3-5 explicit exclusions |
| **Organizational reality ignored** | No honest constraint assessment | Add to Section 2 |
| **Horizons not stage-gated** | H2/H3 assumed regardless of H1 | Add explicit gates |
| **No fallback strategy** | Assumes main thesis works | Add Section 10 |
| **Validation without thresholds** | Hypotheses but no numbers | Add specific thresholds and dates |
| **Crux not resolved** | Epilogue doesn't close loop | Ensure commitment addresses crux |
