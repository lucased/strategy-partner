## Strategy Frameworks

This project uses four integrated strategy frameworks:

1. **Good Strategy/Bad Strategy (Rumelt)**: Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions
2. **Playing to Win (Lafley & Martin)**: Where to Play / How to Win
3. **Three Horizons (McKinsey)**: H1/H2/H3 strategic roadmapping
4. **7 Powers (Helmer)**: Sustainable competitive advantage

## Getting Started

1. Run `/strategy-skills:strategy` to start a strategy session
2. The Strategy Partner agent will guide you through the discovery process
3. Each phase includes checkpoints for validation

## Available Skills

The strategy-skills plugin provides:

- `strategy-diagnosis` - Problem diagnosis and crux identification
- `competitive-analysis` - 7 Powers and competitive positioning
- `stakeholder-mapping` - Organizational reality assessment
- `horizon-planning` - H1/H2/H3 initiative planning
- `market-research` - TAM/SAM/SOM and competitive intelligence
- `strategy-validation` - Strategy quality testing

## Document Generation (Optional)

The plugin includes `lib/docx-helpers.js` for generating Word documents.

```bash
cd lib && npm install  # First time only
```

```javascript
const { h1, h2, para, bullet, createTable, createStrategyDocument, saveDocument } = require('./lib/docx-helpers');

const content = [
  h1("Executive Summary"),
  para("Your strategy summary here..."),
  h2("Key Points"),
  bullet("Point one"),
  bullet("Point two"),
];

const doc = createStrategyDocument("Strategy Title", "Version 1.0", content);
saveDocument(doc, "strategy-output.docx");
```
