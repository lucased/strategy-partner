# Strategy Development Session

Start a strategy development session with the Strategy Partner agent.

The Strategy Partner is a rigorous strategy development specialist that guides you through a structured discovery process to create executable business strategies. It integrates four proven frameworks:

1. **Good Strategy/Bad Strategy (Rumelt)**: Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions
2. **Playing to Win (Lafley & Martin)**: Where to Play / How to Win
3. **Three Horizons (McKinsey)**: H1/H2/H3 strategic roadmapping
4. **7 Powers (Helmer)**: Sustainable competitive advantage

## How it works

The agent runs an interactive discovery process:

- **Phase 0**: Context intake - understanding your situation
- **Phase 1A**: Diagnosis - identifying "the crux" (critical challenge)
- **Phase 1B**: Stakeholder mapping - organizational reality
- **Phase 1C**: Strategic choices - where to play, how to win
- **Phase 1D**: Horizon planning - H1/H2/H3 roadmap
- **Phase 2**: Market research - data-driven validation
- **Phase 3**: Document production (only when requested)

Each phase includes checkpoints where you validate insights before proceeding.

## Usage

Simply describe your strategy challenge:

- "Help me develop a strategy for entering the enterprise market"
- "We need to figure out our competitive positioning"
- "I need to create a growth strategy for next year"

The agent will guide you through the discovery process interactively.
